# MLops AutoML

## Description

This project aims to build a complete end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow using AutoML. 

This project performs hyperparameter tuning and evaluation for multiple machine learning models using RandomizedSearchCV. It iterates over a dictionary of models and their respective hyperparameters, fits each model to the training data, predicts on the test data, calculates the accuracy, and stores the best model and its accuracy in a results dictionary. Finally, it prints the best hyperparameters, accuracy, and a classification report for each model.

This project also  uses LIME library to explain the prediction of a machine learning model for a specific instance from the test dataset and and displays the explanation in the notebook with the top 10 features.

Once the best model is selected and saved to local disk, it upload the model file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket (cloud-ai-platform-9672eb94-cc15-4d36-9868-d4f0fd8a818a). Once the model is uploaded to Google Cloud Storage bucket then it imports a machine learning model from a Google Cloud Storage bucket into Google Vertex AI, and then deploys it to a Vertex AI endpoint.

Once the model is up and running it sends a prediction request to a deployed machine learning model endpoint (https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/1098200441517/locations/us-central1/endpoints/3215782339686694912:predict) on Google Vertex AI.
